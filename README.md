[PostCSS]:             https://github.com/postcss/postcss

This is a modified [postcss-simple-vars] plugin for [PostCSS]. It has similar functionality. Just added preventing overrides.

## Example:

```css
$foo: 200px !important; /* $foo equal 200px */
...
... some CSS ...
... 
... more CSS ...
...
$foo: 400px; /* $foo still equal 200px */
